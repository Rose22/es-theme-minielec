# es-theme-minielec

an extremely versatile and customizable theme, designed to let you handle huge libraries of files with ease! inspired by MiniUI (https://github.com/shauninman/MiniUI) for miyoo mini 

designed for Anbernic RG351 devices (works best on 4:3 and 3:2 screens), but i'm working on making it support a wide variety of things


here's some (outdated!) screenshots:

it features a list view that lets you navigate through your collection very fast, but without sacrificing all scraped media, because both images and videos can be shown in the background of the game list if you choose to turn that on.

it's extremely customizable, it lets you:
  - select from a wide variety of color schemes, each has a dark and a light version
  - use any of the included backgrounds
  - use custom backgrounds
  - use overlays on top of backgrounds
  - tint both the included and custom backgrounds to match the chosen color scheme
  - set the brightness of backgrounds to your liking
  - pick from 4 different fonts
  - turn off the bar that's normally at the top of the screen, so your entire screen is filled with the lists

with all this, you can make it look pretty much however you like, the only limitation is that the only available view for your files and games is a super-clean list!

for it to look as intended, please:
  - set the list transition style to instant
  - go into UI system settings -> developer, then turn off carousel transitions (if you like)
